ðŸš€ Forge â€“ A Game-Changer for AI Development!

Iâ€™ve been diving into the Forge AI Terminal Assistant by Tailcall, and Iâ€™m truly impressed!

We built LLM Chronicle, a web app for organizing LLM and AI guides, and Forge helped us get a fully functional project in minutesâ€”handling everything from architecture to deployment, backend logic to frontend design, and even testing. What would have taken weeks was done effortlessly!

ðŸ’¡ Why should developers try Forge?
âœ… Super fast â€“ Get a complete project setup in under 10 minutes
âœ… Handles complexity â€“ Architecture, backend, frontend, testing, and deploymentâ€”all covered
âœ… Supports all stages of development â€“ From idea to production
âœ… Configurable with multiple LLM models â€“ Flexible and powerful
âœ… Optimized token usage â€“ Handles large contexts efficiently
âœ… Better than VS Code Copilot â€“ More structured and developer-friendly

As I continue diving deeper into Forge, Iâ€™m excited about its potential to optimize AI workflows and elevate the developer experience. Looking forward to seeing how it evolves! ðŸš€
