        <h2>What is Prompt Engineering?</h2>
        <p>
          Prompt engineering is the practice of designing, optimizing, and refining inputs to large language models
          (LLMs) to
          generate desired outputs. It's a critical skill that bridges human intent with AI capabilities, allowing
          you to effectively "program" language models through carefully crafted instructions.

Let's solve this step by step:
1) John starts with 5 apples
2) John gives 2 apples to Mary, leaving John with 5 - 2 = 3 apples
3) John buys 3 more apples, giving him 3 + 3 = 6 apples
4) John gives half of his apples to his brother, which is 6 รท 2 = 3 apples
5) Therefore, John has 6 - 3 = 3 apples left`}
