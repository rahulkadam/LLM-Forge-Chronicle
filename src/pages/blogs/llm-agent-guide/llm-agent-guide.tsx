          <p>
            When you hear "LLM Agent," you might picture a complex AI system that can do everything. 
            But let me tell you a secret: it's just a fancy name for a function that uses an LLM to do specific tasks. 
            That's it! Let's break down why this simple concept has become so mystified and how you can use it in your projects.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="why-complex">
          <h2>Why People Think It's Complex</h2>
          <p>
            The term "Agent" has been around in AI for decades, often associated with complex systems that can:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Make autonomous decisions</li>
            <li>Learn from experience</li>
            <li>Interact with their environment</li>
            <li>Have goals and objectives</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            When this term got attached to LLMs, people started thinking these were some kind of super-intelligent systems. 
            But in reality, an LLM Agent is just a function that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Takes some input</li>
            <li>Uses an LLM to process it</li>
            <li>Returns some output</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="simple-truth">
          <h2>The Simple Truth</h2>
          <p>
            An LLM Agent is nothing more than a function that wraps around an LLM to do specific tasks. 
            Think of it like this:
          </p>
          <div className="code-example">
            <pre>
              <code>
{`// A simple function
function calculateSum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// An LLM Agent (just another function!)
function analyzeSentiment(text) {
  return llm.analyze(text, "What's the sentiment of this text?");
}`}
              </code>
            </pre>
          </div>
          <p>
            The only difference is that instead of doing math, it's using an LLM to do something with text or data. 
            That's all there is to it!
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="technical-side">
          <h2>The Technical Side</h2>
          <p>
            The term "Agent" was chosen because these functions often:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Act on behalf of something (like a user or system)</li>
            <li>Can be chained together to do more complex tasks</li>
            <li>Might use tools or APIs to accomplish their goals</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            But at their core, they're just functions that use LLMs. The fancy name helps distinguish them from regular functions 
            because they're specifically designed to work with language models.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="real-example">
          <h2>A Real Example</h2>
          <p>
            Let's look at a simple example of an LLM Agent that helps with customer support:
          </p>
          <div className="code-example">
            <pre>
              <code>
{`// A simple customer support agent
async function customerSupportAgent(userMessage) {
  // 1. Understand the user's issue
  const issue = await llm.analyze(userMessage, "What's the main issue?");
  
  // 2. Check if we have a solution
  const solution = await checkKnowledgeBase(issue);
  
  // 3. Generate a response
  const response = await llm.generate(
    "Generate a helpful response to this customer issue",
    { issue, solution }
  );
  
  return response;
}`}
              </code>
            </pre>
          </div>
          <p>
            This agent is just three functions working together:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>One to understand the problem</li>
            <li>One to look up a solution</li>
            <li>One to generate a response</li>
          </ol>
        </section>

          <p>
            Here are some simple ways businesses use LLM Agents:

            <div className="use-case">
              <h3>Customer Support</h3>

            <div className="use-case">

            Remember: LLM Agents are just functions that use language models. 
            Don't let the fancy name intimidate you - they're powerful tools that are simpler than they seem!
