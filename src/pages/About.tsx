        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          ChronoPrompt empowers developers with the knowledge and tools to master Large Language Model (LLM) applications. 
          We bridge the gap between theoretical AI concepts and practical implementation, making advanced LLM technologies 
          accessible to developers at all skill levels.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="about-section">
        <h2>Why We Started ChronoPrompt</h2>
        <p>
          We noticed a significant gap in practical, developer-focused resources for LLMs. Existing tutorials either oversimplified 
          complex concepts or presented advanced techniques without establishing proper foundations.
        </p>
        <p>
          As developers ourselves, we experienced the frustration of piecing together knowledge from scattered resources across 
          the internet. We envisioned a centralized platform providing a structured learning path ‚Äî from fundamentals to advanced 
          techniques ‚Äî specifically designed for developers integrating LLMs into real-world applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our core mission is to democratize LLM expertise, enabling more developers to build innovative, responsible, and effective 
          AI-powered applications that solve meaningful problems in today's rapidly evolving technological landscape.
